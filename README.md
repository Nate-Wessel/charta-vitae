# Charta Vitae
This project is meant as a playful and engaging alternative to the standardized and inevitably vapid *[curriculum vitae](https://natewessel.com/resume/)*. Instead of accepting the terms of the *curriculum ratti* I prefer to complicate the matter, expanding the *curriculum* into a *charta humanis*, a *charta vitae*, a map of life. 

In a nutshell, what I'm doing here is essentially expanding an online portfolio, stored in WordPress, into a set of interconnected "projects" which are queried and then visualized with d3. Each project can be part of a larger effort and may contain its own sub-projects, or have causal links to still other projects. Projects can be classified and grouped with arbitrary tags, and can contain references to collaborators because in a *charta humanis*, actual people are of central importance. 

Real projects are messy and develop over time and relate to other things going on in one's life. Some things seem unrelated by the end but come from a common source, or start unrelated and merge in eventual synthesis. Gaps in one field are explained by a burst of activity in some other area. An abstract list of technical capabilities comes out of actual practice on tangible things to which the skills are linked.
