# Charta Vitae (Map of Life)
This project is meant to update my old [graphic resume](http://natewessel.com/cartography/resume-2/) using ideas from my "[sitemap](http://cincymap.org/sitemap/)" project. I'll use content in/from my WordPress websites to generate a dynamic visualization of my body of work over the last decade as it develops, changes focus, loses direction, etc. 

The idea behind this is to add dimensions to the standard academic [curriculum vitae](http://natewessel.com/cv/), with its long lists of categorized and standardized entries. Projects develop over time and relate to other things going on in one's life. Some things seem unrelated by the end but come from a common source, or start unrelated and merge in synthesis. Gaps in one field are explained by a burst of activity in some other area. That list of technical capabilities comes out of actual practice on tangible things to which the skills are linked.

This project is also meant to reconcile my economic need to create a resume/portfolio with a refusal to portray myself one-dimensionally, with so many of the fun bits removed.

## Plan of Work:
* find out what can be efficiently queried from wordpress posts (are custom post types needed for events?)
* create an ontology vitae (links, splits, nativity, death, etc)
* determine the nature of time (linear? cyclical? radial?)
* determine the screen/device this can be designed for
* will this be stochastic or deterministic?
* is there a _here_?
* ...
