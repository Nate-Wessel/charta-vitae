# Curriculum Vitae (Life Course)
This project is meant to update my old [graphic resume](http://natewessel.com/cartography/resume-2/) using ideas from my "[sitemap](http://cincymap.org/sitemap/)" project. I'll use content in/from my WordPress websites to generate a dynamic visualization of my body of work over the last decade as it develops, changes focus, loses direction, etc.
